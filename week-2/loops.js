// when you have many things to print, instead of suffering with doing console.log for everything. just use loops
//loop for
let fruits = [bananas, apples, pears, strawberries]
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length;  i++ {
    console.log(i);   
} // with i being a variable to represent the index while 0 shows the starting point to loop

// loop in
let backpack = {
    books=3,
    pen="bic",
    snacks="daddies, crisps"
};
for (let item in backpack) {
    
}
// B.Loops
//   loops iteration statements
//   1. for loop
//   2. while loop
//   3. do-while loop
